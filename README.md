To-Do App (MERN Stack)
A simple To-Do application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This app allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. It demonstrates a basic full-stack application with user authentication and CRUD operations.

Features
Create: Add new tasks with a title and description.
Read: View a list of all tasks.
Update: Mark tasks as completed or edit their details.
Delete: Remove tasks from the list.
Authentication: Sign up and log in to manage your tasks securely.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose for schema modeling)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
State Management: React useState / useEffect
Installation
Prerequisites
Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version >= 14.x)
MongoDB (or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Sojha09/todo-app.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd mern-todo-app
Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend directory to store sensitive information like the MongoDB connection string and JWT secret:

env
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The backend should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
